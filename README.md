SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Connecting an alumni association to a university is a powerful way to create a long-lasting relationship between the institution and its graduates. It can foster mutual growth, provide valuable opportunities for current students, and allow alumni to give back to the university.

Alumni Portal with Integrated University Systems : Create a unified digital portal that integrates the university's student database, career services, event management, and alumni networks. The portal should allow alumni to update their contact information, participate in university events, donate, volunteer, and access university resources (e.g., libraries, online courses). Career Networking and Mentorship Programs :Establish a mentorship program where alumni can guide current students or recent graduates in career development. Incorporate the alumni portal to match students with alumni mentors based on shared fields of interest or industries. Encourage alumni to provide career advice, internships, job shadowing, or even full-time employment opportunities. Annual Alumni Events and Virtual Engagement : Host both in-person and virtual alumni events such as reunions, webinars, and industry talks that keep alumni engaged with the university.Leverage video conferencing platforms or social media groups to organize online events, enabling global participation, and keeping alumni in the loop with university initiatives. Alumni-Student Networking Platforms : Develop dedicated spaces within the alumni platform for students and alumni to network, share internship opportunities, and collaborate on projects. Facilitate alumni participation in career fairs, guest speaker opportunities, and student clubs to foster interaction. Alumni Fundraising and Giving Programs : Link alumni to the university’s donation platform, making it easier for them to contribute to scholarships, research, campus projects, or other university needs. Implement a loyalty or recognition program for regular donors to increase participation in giving campaigns. Alumni Directory and Database Integration : Maintain an up-to-date alumni directory that integrates with the university’s CRM system for easy communication, targeting specific alumni groups based on location, major, or graduation year.Offer advanced search capabilities for alumni to connect with peers, form professional networks, or discover opportunities for collaboration.
